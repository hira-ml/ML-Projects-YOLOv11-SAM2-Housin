#  Brain Tumor Segmentation & Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains two machine learning projects completed as part of my AI coursework:

- **Task 01: Brain Tumor Segmentation**  
  Uses YOLOv11 and SAM2 to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images.

- **Task 02: California Housing Price Prediction**  
  Implements an end-to-end ML pipeline using regression models to predict median house prices.


 
##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv11
- Meta's SAM2 (Segment Anything Model)
